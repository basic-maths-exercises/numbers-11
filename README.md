# The set of rational numbers

As you hopefully worked out the set of integers is closed under to operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication.  It is not closed under the operation of division.  We thus introduce a new set of numbers the rational numbers and state that:

_A number x is called rational if it can be written as the quotient of two integers i.e., in the form p/q where p and q belong to the set of integers and where q is not equal to zero._

__Your task in this exercise is to complete the function called `isRational` in `main.py`.  This function takes two integers `p` and `q` in the input.  The function should return 1 if `p/q` is rational and 0 otherwise.__
